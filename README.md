# Age-estimation-by-MultiStream-CNN
• In this project, I used to extract the face feature (Eye, Nose, Eyebrow, and Mouth) using the DLib library and pass each feature to each of the multi-stream CNN layers. After passing Through Multi-stream CNN the output is concatenated and again passes through the CNN model, the output of CNN is estimated age. •Project uses the Adience dataset for the training of the Multi-Stream CNN Model.
